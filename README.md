# Lootwright: Intelligent Loot Generator for TTRPGs

Lootwright is an intelligent treasure generation tool designed for Tabletop RPG Game Masters who need quick, balanced, and flavorful loot on-the-fly. When players go "off the map" or GMs need low-prep solutions, Lootwright generates contextually appropriate treasure parcels that feel authentic to the world while maintaining mechanical balance according to D&D 5e guidelines.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the following command to start the development server:

## Key Principles

1.  **Speed First:** Generate complete treasure parcels in under 3 seconds
2.  **Contextual Intelligence:** Adapt loot composition based on source context
3.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple by default, detailed on demand
4.  **DMG Compliance:** Strict adherence to D&D 5e treasure balance guidelines
